##The point of this question is to discuss the best possible way to finish the course. For the week of March 23rd, there will be a set of video lectures and this homework assignment, but no lab. I have set up 5 modules for the remaining weeks of the class. My current thought would be to have a recorded video lecture in place of our traditional Tuesday class. Students can work in groups (remotely, of course), alone, or I will work through the labs using a live video conference (likely Google Hangouts Meet or Webex).

##a.
## Do you have any suggestions about the structure of the course for the last 5 weeks?
  ##no at this time

##b.
##What are you most concerned about with the remainder of this course?
  ##being able to work through the code and not have the ability for face to face questions and explainations.
##c.
##What can I do to help you sucessfully complete this course?
 ##Be availible for question and concerns whenever you can.
